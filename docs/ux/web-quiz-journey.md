### Stage 2: Select Quiz
**Doing**: Expands Available Quizzes, picks a quiz
**Thinking**: “Is this the right set and difficulty?”
**Feeling**: Curious, time-limited
**Pain**: Menu jitter, sub-item borders and transforms
**Opportunity**: Compact list, no transform, keyboard activation, ellipsis for long names

### Stage 3: Practice
**Doing**: Answers questions with instant correct/incorrect feedback
**Thinking**: “Is my answer normalized and fairly checked?”
**Feeling**: Focused; wants fast cycle time
**Pain**: Hover-induced layout shifts, unclear feedback wording, timer visibility
**Opportunity**: Minimal styles, stable buttons, clear normalization, visible timer

### Stage 4: Finish & Review
**Doing**: Finishes quiz, sees pass/fail and failure list
**Thinking**: “Where did I go wrong? Can I scan quickly?”
**Feeling**: Reflective, time-conscious
**Pain**: Heavy boxes, cluttered results, poor scanning
**Opportunity**: Light stat cards, subtle failure accents, concise copy, auto HTML report

### Stage 5: Track Progress
