# User Journey: Certification Exam Practice

## User Persona
- **Who**: Certification candidate (beginner → expert)
- **Goal**: Practice daily to consistently achieve ≥80% on targeted quizzes
- **Context**: Desktop, time-boxed 20–40 min sessions, high-stakes prep
- **Success Metric**: Quick start, clear feedback, efficient failure review, improving scores

## Journey Stages

### Stage 1: Plan Session
**Doing**: Opens dashboard, decides which quiz/topic to run
**Thinking**: “I need a focused set right now.”
**Feeling**: Determined but time-aware
**Pain**: Confusing navigation, slow start
**Opportunity**: Breadcrumb, stable layout, one-click start

### Stage 2: Select Quiz
**Doing**: Expands Available Quizzes, picks a quiz
**Thinking**: “Is this the right set and difficulty?”
**Feeling**: Curious, time-limited
**Pain**: Menu jitter, sub-item borders and transforms
**Opportunity**: Compact list, no transform, keyboard activation, ellipsis for long names

### Stage 3: Practice
**Doing**: Answers questions with instant correct/incorrect feedback
**Thinking**: “Is my answer normalized and fairly checked?”
**Feeling**: Focused; wants fast cycle time
**Pain**: Hover-induced layout shifts, unclear feedback wording, timer visibility
**Opportunity**: Minimal styles, stable buttons, clear normalization, visible timer

### Stage 4: Finish & Review
**Doing**: Finishes quiz, sees pass/fail and failure list
**Thinking**: “Where did I go wrong? Can I scan quickly?”
**Feeling**: Reflective, time-conscious
**Pain**: Heavy boxes, cluttered results, poor scanning
**Opportunity**: Light stat cards, subtle failure accents, concise copy, auto HTML report

### Stage 5: Track Progress
**Doing**: Sees recent runs, pass rate, trend
**Thinking**: “Am I improving toward ≥80%?”
**Feeling**: Motivated or needs adjustment
**Pain**: Missing history, unclear metrics
**Opportunity**: Dashboard stats, recent runs timeline, stable breadcrumb
