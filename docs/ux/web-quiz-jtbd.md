# Web Quiz – Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

## Job Statement
When preparing for a certification exam on desktop during daily practice, I want fast, reliable quiz sessions with instant feedback and clear progress tracking, so I can build confidence and reach the passing threshold before the exam date.

## Context & User
- **Who**: Certification candidate (all levels)
- **Device**: Mostly desktop
- **Frequency**: Daily practice, time-boxed sessions
- **Stakes**: High — important exam preparation

## Current Solutions & Pain Points
- **Current**: Paper notes, spreadsheets, generic quiz sites, LMS modules, flashcards (e.g., Anki)
- **Pain**:
  - Inconsistent answer validation for multi-part answers
  - Slow or distracting UI; layout shifts on hover/click
  - Poor visibility of progress and time spent
  - Weak failure review (hard to scan what went wrong)
  - No trustworthy, auto-generated report to track attempts

## Desired Outcomes
- **Primary**: Complete focused practice sets (25–50 questions) with accurate feedback and reach ≥80% score consistently
- **Secondary**: Understand mistakes quickly and improve weak areas
- **Tertiary**: Maintain momentum with session-to-session analytics

## Success Metrics
- **Time-to-start**: < 15 seconds from dashboard to first question
- **Feedback clarity**: 95% of users rate feedback as “clear”
- **Review efficiency**: Failures scannable in < 2 minutes per session
- **Progress**: ≥ 3 sessions/week, steady increase in average score

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Minimalistic, distraction-free UI
- Keyboard-friendly interactions and accessible dialog semantics
- Consistent normalization of answers (case/whitespace/multi-part)
