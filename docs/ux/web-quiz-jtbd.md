## Job Statement (Student)
When studying course material across desktop and mobile, I want guided practice with clear explanations and progress indicators, so I can master concepts, complete assignments on time, and feel confident before quizzes and exams.

## Context & User (Student)
- **Who**: Student (high school, college, bootcamp)
- **Device**: Mixed — school desktops and personal mobile phones
- **Frequency**: Weekly assignments and in-class practice; shorter sessions
- **Stakes**: Medium — grades and understanding; teacher oversight

## Current Solutions & Pain Points (Student)
- **Current**: LMS quizzes, printed worksheets, flashcards, study groups
- **Pain**:
  - Hard to use on mobile; small tap targets, poor focus states
  - Unclear feedback; no hints or step-through explanations
  - Progress is opaque; difficult to know readiness level
  - Motivation dips without positive reinforcement or streaks

## Desired Outcomes (Student)
- **Primary**: Finish assigned practice sets with immediate, instructive feedback
- **Secondary**: Learn from mistakes using hints or explanations (if enabled)
- **Tertiary**: Track streaks and improvements; resume work across devices

## Success Metrics (Student)
- **Mobile usability**: Tap targets ≥24px, focus visible, no layout jumps

## Shared Constraints & Assumptions
- Minimalistic, distraction-free UI
- Keyboard-friendly interactions and accessible dialog semantics
- Consistent normalization of answers (case/whitespace/multi-part)
- Mobile-first considerations: responsive layout, reduced motion when preferred
